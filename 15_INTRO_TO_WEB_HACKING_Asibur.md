# 🛡 TRYHACKME ROOM REPORT — 15: INTRO TO WEB HACKING  
🔗 [Room Link → https://tryhackme.com/room/introtowebhacking](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtowebhacking)  
📅 Date Completed: July 10, 2025  
📂 Category: Web Application Security (Concept)  
🎯 Focus: XSS, IDOR, Cookie Tampering, Request Analysis  
🧩 Difficulty: 🟢 Beginner

## 🧠 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The *Intro to Web Hacking* room provides a foundational understanding of how websites can be vulnerable to input-based attacks. This room *does not involve practical machine exploitation*, but teaches crucial web concepts such as:

- *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*
- *Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)*
- *Cookie tampering*
- *Burp Suite interception & manipulation*

By learning these, ethical hackers can recognize weak points in web applications before doing hands-on exploitation in future rooms.

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP LEARNING BREAKDOWN

| Step | Key Focus Area | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | *Form Behavior* | Learn how forms use GET/POST and how data can leak via URL |
| 2️⃣ | *XSS Basics* | Understand how unfiltered input leads to script execution |
| 3️⃣ | *IDOR* | See how URL manipulation grants unauthorized access |
| 4️⃣ | *Burp Suite* | Capture and alter login requests, headers, parameters |
| 5️⃣ | *Cookie Analysis* | Decode and manipulate session tokens to gain access |

## 🧰 TOOLS, COMMANDS & CONFIGURATIONS

| Tool/Feature          | Purpose / Use Case                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| *Burp Suite (Proxy)* | Intercept requests and modify input/headers     |
| *Browser DevTools*   | Inspect forms, input types, and page source     |
| *Base64 Decoder*     | Decode cookies to reveal session details        |
| *JavaScript Payloads*| Inject XSS test strings                         |
| *Manual URL Editing* | Test IDOR vulnerabilities manually              |

---

## 🧪 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES (THEORETICAL LAB CASES)

✅ *XSS Attack via Input Field*  
- Input: <script>alert('Hacked')</script>  
- Result: Alert popup indicates vulnerable input field

✅ *IDOR via URL Manipulation*  
- Original: https://site.com/profile?user=asibur  
- Changed to: https://site.com/profile?user=admin  
- Result: Admin profile loaded — unauthorized access

✅ *Cookie Tampering*  
- Cookie: session=eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ==  
- Decoded: { "user": "admin" }  
- Result: Gained admin panel access

✅ *Login Request Interception*  
- POST /login captured in Burp  
- Manipulated password parameter  
- Response changed → login success

## 🔍 RESPONSE ANALYSIS STRATEGY

| Observation                  | Meaning                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 📏 Response length increase  | Page accepted the payload                |
| ✅ Status 200/302 redirect   | Login or action success                  |
| ⚠ Error message shown       | Possible injection or broken logic      |
| 🔁 New page loaded           | Indicates context change (priv escalation)|

## 🔐 SECURITY INSIGHTS & ATTACK PATHS

| Technique        | Risk Prevented By                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| XSS              | Input sanitization & output encoding               |
| IDOR             | Enforce authorization on server side               |
| Cookie Tampering | Use signed/hashed tokens with validation           |
| Insecure Forms   | Use POST for sensitive data + HTTPS enforcement    |

## 🖼 RECOMMENDED SCREENSHOTS (For GitHub/Fiverr Portfolio)

- 📸 XSS input + alert popup  
- 📸 URL IDOR test with unauthorized access  
- 📸 Burp request interception (username/password)  
- 📸 Decoded cookie in Base64 decoder  
- 📸 DevTools form inspection panel  

---

## 📝 FINAL THOUGHTS

This room builds the *mental model of a web attacker* — it trains you to:

- Think like a hacker  
- Question form methods, URLs, and cookies  
- Analyze request-response behavior before exploiting

Although it doesn’t include a hands-on machine, it gives the mindset to approach future rooms like:

- *Room 16:* Injection (SQLi/XSS)  
- *Room 17:* Brute Force  
- *Room 18:* Broken Authentication

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (ASIBUR RAHAMAN ACTION PLAN)

- ✅ Add screenshots and diagrams  
- ✅ Upload to GitHub repo: TryHackMe-Reports  
- ✅ Create short tutorial: “How to Spot IDOR in 2 mins”  
- 💼 Offer Fiverr Gig: “I will audit your site for XSS/IDOR”  
- 🎯 Start Room 16: Injection — Practical SQLi & XSS exploitation
