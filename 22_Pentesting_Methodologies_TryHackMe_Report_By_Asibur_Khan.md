## 🧠 1. Room Overview

This room covers industry-standard *penetration testing methodologies* — including the phases, frameworks, and ethics involved in professional ethical hacking.  
It explains the real-world workflow that penetration testers follow during client engagements, aligned with standards like *PTES*, *OWASP*, and *NIST*.

## 🛠️ 2. Methodologies Covered

| Methodology | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| *PTES* (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) | A professional and structured guide for conducting pentests |
| *OWASP Testing Guide* | Focused on web application vulnerabilities |
| *NIST SP 800-115* | Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment |
| *OSSTMM* | Focuses on operational security metrics |

## 📋 3. Pentesting Phases Explained

### 1️⃣ Pre-engagement
- Understand scope, authorization, legal boundaries
- Define targets, timelines, and deliverables
- Sign NDA or legal contracts

### 2️⃣ Reconnaissance (Passive & Active)
- Passive: WHOIS, Google Dorking, LinkedIn, Shodan
- Active: Nmap, ping sweeps, DNS enum

### 3️⃣ Threat Modeling & Planning
- Identify high-risk targets
- Map attack surface
- Create testing plan

### 4️⃣ Exploitation
- Exploit vulnerabilities found
- Use tools like Metasploit, Hydra, Burp Suite
- Avoid detection (stealth where needed)

### 5️⃣ Post-Exploitation
- Access deeper networks or systems
- Enumerate sensitive files or creds
- Pivoting & privilege escalation

### 6️⃣ Reporting
- Clear, client-focused documentation
- Include: vulnerabilities, PoC, risk ratings, remediation

## 📝 8. Personal Notes

- Methodology is the *heart of ethical hacking* — without it, everything becomes chaotic.
- Having a roadmap like PTES ensures professionalism and legal safety.
- Reporting is not just a formality — it's *what the client really pays for*.
