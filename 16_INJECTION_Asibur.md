# 💉 TRYHACKME ROOM REPORT — 16: INJECTION  
🔗 [Room Link → https://tryhackme.com/room/injection](https://tryhackme.com/room/injection)  
📅 Date Completed: July 11, 2025  
📂 Category: Web Application Security (Injection Attacks)  
🎯 Focus: SQL Injection, Command Injection, HTML Injection  
🧩 Difficulty: 🟢 Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 🧠 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The *Injection* room teaches us how attackers manipulate inputs to control backend behavior in web apps. These attacks target *database queries, **system commands, and **HTML rendering*. The lab includes:

- *SQL Injection (SQLi)* via GET/POST
- *Command Injection* via form input
- *HTML Injection* via comment fields

Injection flaws are among the *OWASP Top 10* because they can expose sensitive data, allow unauthorized access, or even give system-level control.

---

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP LEARNING BREAKDOWN

| Step | Focus Area              | Description |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | *SQLi (GET request)*     | Inject SQL in URL to extract data |
| 2️⃣ | *SQLi (Login form)*      | Bypass login with crafted payload |
| 3️⃣ | *HTML Injection*         | Inject HTML tags in comment section |
| 4️⃣ | *Command Injection (Ping)* | Inject system commands into form |
| 5️⃣ | *Command Chaining*       | Use ;, &&, | to chain commands |

---

## 🧰 TOOLS, COMMANDS & CONFIGURATIONS

| Tool / Payload         | Purpose / Usage |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| ' OR '1'='1          | SQLi to bypass login |
| 127.0.0.1; whoami    | Command Injection |
| <h1>Hacked</h1>      | HTML Injection example |
| Burp Suite           | Intercept and test requests |
| DevTools (F12)       | Inspect forms and HTML |
| base64, urlencode  | Encode payloads when needed |

## 🧪 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES (LAB CASES)

✅ *SQL Injection via Login*  
- *Input*:  
  Username: `admin' -- `  
  Password: irrelevant  
- *Result*: Login success without knowing password

✅ *Command Injection Test*  
- *Input*: 127.0.0.1; whoami  
- *Result*: Displays the system user (e.g., www-data)

✅ *HTML Injection*  
- *Input*: <marquee>Hacked by Asibur</marquee>  
- *Result*: Scrolling message shown in browser

✅ *URL SQLi*  
- *URL*: http://<IP>/product?id=1' OR '1'='1  
- *Result*: Returns all products (bypass ID filter)

## 🔍 RESPONSE ANALYSIS STRATEGY

| Symptom                     | What It Means |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| ❌ SQL Error (e.g., syntax) | Possible injection point |
| ✅ Login success (unexpected)| Login bypass via SQLi |
| 🖼 HTML rendered in output   | HTML injection success |
| 📜 Terminal output in response | Command executed on server |

---

## 🔐 SECURITY INSIGHTS & ATTACK PATHS

| Attack Type     | Risk Mitigation |
|------------------|------------------|
| *SQL Injection* | Use prepared statements (Parameterized Queries) |
| *Command Injection* | Sanitize inputs and avoid eval, exec |
| *HTML Injection* | Encode user input/output |
| *Form Input Exploits* | Always validate server-side, not just client-side |

## 🖼 RECOMMENDED SCREENSHOTS (For GitHub/Fiverr)

- 📸 SQLi login bypass screenshot  
- 📸 Command Injection (with output)  
- 📸 HTML Injection (rendered tag in UI)  
- 📸 Burp Suite POST request with SQL payload  
- 📸 Source code showing unfiltered inputs (if available)

---

## 📝 FINAL THOUGHTS

This room acts as a *gateway to offensive web security* by teaching the anatomy of injections. It builds the practical mindset to test real-world sites safely and responsibly.

- Think like an attacker  
- Validate everything  
- Assume no input is safe by default  

This knowledge prepares you for upcoming rooms involving *authentication bypass, **data extraction, and **OS-level exploitation*.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (ASIBUR RAHAMAN ACTION PLAN)

- ✅ Add screenshots from lab walkthrough  
- ✅ Upload this report to GitHub under TryHackMe-Reports  
- 📹 Record short video: “SQLi Login Bypass in 2 Minutes”  
- 💼 Create Fiverr Gig: “I will test your site for Injection Vulnerabilities”  
- ▶ Start Next Room: *Brute Force (Room 17)*
