## 🧠 1. Room Overview

This room covers fundamental concepts of *web exploitation*, focusing on common vulnerabilities and attack techniques against web applications.  
It provides practical exercises on identifying and exploiting issues like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws.

## 🛠️ 2. Tools & Techniques Used

| Tool           | Purpose                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Burp Suite     | Intercepting and modifying web requests |
| SQLMap         | Automated SQL Injection testing         |
| Browser DevTools | Inspecting and manipulating web elements|
| Manual Testing | Input validation and session testing    |

## 🚀 3. Step-by-Step Exploitation Process

### Step 1: Reconnaissance and Information Gathering
- Analyzed web pages and parameters using browser developer tools.
- Used Burp Suite proxy to intercept requests and responses.

### Step 2: Testing for SQL Injection
- Identified vulnerable input fields.
- Used SQLMap with proper payloads to confirm SQL injection vulnerability.

### Step 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing
- Tested input fields for reflected and stored XSS.
- Injected scripts and verified execution on client-side.

### Step 4: Authentication Flaws
- Tested login functionality for weak passwords and session management issues.
- Checked for password reset mechanisms vulnerabilities.
