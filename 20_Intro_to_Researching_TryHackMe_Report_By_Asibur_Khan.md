## 🚀 3. Step-by-Step Research Process

### 🔍 Step 1: Identify the Topic
- Chose a target (e.g., a specific vulnerability or system).
- Defined what I need to find: exploit, impact, mitigation.

### 🌐 Step 2: Use Search Engines Efficiently
- Used Google Dorking (e.g., site:exploit-db.com inurl:CVE-2021)  
- Discovered working public exploits and proof-of-concepts (POCs).

### 📚 Step 3: Dive into Official Resources
- Checked *CVE Details* for vulnerability severity and references.
- Used *NVD*, *Red Team Blog*, and *GitHub repos* for deeper analysis.

### ⚔️ Step 4: Threat Intelligence Gathering
- Collected data on known threat actors from MITRE ATT&CK.
- Understood real-world use of the exploit in recent attacks.
