## 🌟 Executive Summary

This room introduces the *foundations of defensive security*, including how to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats using tools and techniques used in a *Security Operations Center (SOC)*. 

Unlike offensive security, this focuses on *monitoring, logging, alerting*, and *responding to incidents* in real-time to protect systems and data.

## 🗒️ Personal Notes

This room gave me a clear understanding of how blue teams operate and defend against real threats. As a penetration tester, this perspective is *critical* for understanding how to *evade* detection and also how to collaborate with SOC teams during red team engagements.
