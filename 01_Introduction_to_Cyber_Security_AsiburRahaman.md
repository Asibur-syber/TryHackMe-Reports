## 🧠 Key Concepts Breakdown

### ✅ What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, software, and data from digital attacks and unauthorized access.

### ✅ CIA Triad Explained:

| Core Principle     | Real-World Meaning                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| *Confidentiality* | Data privacy: Only authorized access (e.g., encryption) |
| *Integrity*       | Data trustworthiness: No unauthorized changes           |
| *Availability*    | System uptime: Access when needed                      |

## 🧑‍💻 Types of Hackers / Threat Actors

| Actor Type         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎩 *Black Hat*     | Criminal hackers performing unauthorized attacks for personal gain          |
| 🤝 *White Hat*     | Ethical hackers identifying and fixing vulnerabilities legally              |
| ⚫ *Grey Hat*      | Blend of white and black; operates without malicious intent but illegally    |
| 🎮 *Script Kiddie* | Uses existing tools without deep knowledge of the exploit                   |
| 🧑‍💼 *Insider Threat* | Employees or users misusing internal access to harm the system             |
| 🏴 *Nation-State*  | State-sponsored attackers conducting cyber warfare or espionage             |
