# 🛡 TRYHACKME ROOM REPORT — 13: BURP SUITE REPEATER  
🔗 [Room Link → https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater)  
📅 Date Completed: July 8, 2025  
📂 Category: Manual Web Application Testing  
🎯 Focus: Request Manipulation, Auth Bypass, Response Analysis  
🧩 Difficulty: 🟢 Beginner

---

## 🧠 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The *Burp Suite Repeater* room trains ethical hackers to *manually test and manipulate HTTP requests*.  
Repeater is ideal for:
- Bypassing authentication,
- Testing input validation,
- Debugging and refining payloads manually.

Through real-world examples, the learner discovers how small changes in headers, parameters, or cookies can reveal major security flaws.

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP LEARNING BREAKDOWN

| Step | Focus | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | *Intercept Request* | Use Burp Proxy to capture login requests. |
| 2️⃣ | *Send to Repeater* | Right-click > Send to Repeater for manual editing. |
| 3️⃣ | *Manipulate Request* | Change method, parameters, cookies, or headers. |
| 4️⃣ | *Observe Response* | Analyze HTTP status, body, and error messages. |
| 5️⃣ | *Repeat* | Adjust inputs and re-send to fine-tune the attack. |

## 🧰 TOOLS & CONFIGURATIONS USED

| Tool / Feature        | Purpose                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| *Burp Suite Repeater* | Manual request tampering and replaying         |
| *FoxyProxy*          | Route browser traffic to Burp Proxy            |
| *Kali Linux*         | Secure pentesting environment                  |
| *Browser + Login Form* | Target web form to capture HTTP requests       |
| *TryHackMe Web VM*   | Lab environment for testing vulnerabilities     |

---

## 🧪 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES (FROM LAB TASKS)

✅ *Bypassed Login via Cookie Tampering*  
- Intercepted POST request with incorrect password  
- Sent to Repeater  
- Modified cookie value from:
- Re-sent request — gained access without valid credentials.

✅ *Input Field Manipulation*  
- Changed username=admin to username=’ OR ‘1’=’1  
- Re-sent — server responded with welcome page (SQLi detected)

✅ *Testing Header Injection*  
- Modified User-Agent and Referer headers  
- Observed how server behavior changed — used for recon and bypassing filters

## 🔍 RESPONSE ANALYSIS STRATEGY

| Indicator               | What It Means                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Same response         | No change — test failed                     |
| 🛑 HTTP 403 / 401        | Access denied — credentials needed          |
| ✅ HTTP 200 / Redirect   | Possible success or bypass achieved         |
| ⚠ Error messages        | Useful for discovering SQLi or logic flaws  |
| 📏 Length change         | Indicates successful injection/bypass       |

## 🔐 SECURITY INSIGHTS

| Technique              | Purpose & Value                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| *Cookie tampering*   | Access control bypass                       |
| *Manual fuzzing*     | Detect input validation flaws               |
| *Header injection*   | Recon server behavior                       |
| *Repeater testing*   | Ideal for low-noise manual exploitation     |
| *Custom payload tuning* | Helps refine attack vectors silently        |

## 📝 FINAL THOUGHTS

Burp Suite Repeater is one of the most valuable manual tools for web hackers.  
It allows:
- Low-noise, stealthy testing,
- Flexible payload adjustments,
- Precise input control,
- No rate-limiting issues compared to automation.

🎯 “One correct manual request can reveal what 1,000 automated scans miss.”
