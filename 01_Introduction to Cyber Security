# Introduction to Cyber Security

Cyber Security is the discipline dedicated to protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. In todayâ€™s highly digital and interconnected world, the importance of cyber security cannot be overstated, as it safeguards the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information across all sectors.

Organizations and individuals face a continuously evolving landscape of cyber threats, including malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, insider threats, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). These attacks can result in significant financial loss, reputational damage, legal consequences, and erosion of customer trust.

The foundation of effective cyber security is built upon three core principles, often referred to as the CIA triad:

- *Confidentiality:* Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users and preventing unauthorized disclosure.  
- *Integrity:* Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data by protecting it from unauthorized modification or destruction.  
- *Availability:* Guaranteeing that information systems and data are accessible to authorized users whenever needed.

Cyber security is a multidisciplinary field encompassing network security, application security, endpoint protection, identity and access management, security operations, and incident response. It involves the deployment of advanced technologies, comprehensive policies, and skilled professionals to proactively identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and respond swiftly to security incidents.

As technology continues to advance, cyber adversaries adapt their tactics and techniques, making continuous innovation and vigilance essential in the cyber security domain. Ultimately, cyber security is not only a technical imperative but also a critical component of organizational resilience and public trust in the digital era.
